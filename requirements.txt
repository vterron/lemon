# The reason why we need two different requirements files, and also
# why numpy>=1.7.1 is not included in any of them, is that some of
# the packages depend on another package in order to even run their
# setup.py, without mattering that the dependency is also going to be
# installed. As explained by the pip developers, these are broken
# setup.py files, not pip's fault. Serial installation is the only
# answer here [https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/25]
