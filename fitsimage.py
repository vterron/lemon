        A copy of the header of the FITS file is kept in memory for fast access

        readable, and NonStardardFITS in case that it does not conform to the
        FITS standard or it simply is not a FITS file at all.

        FITS Standard Document:
        http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html

        An image is considered to follow the FITS standard if it has 'SIMPLE'
        as its first keyword of the primary header. According to the standard,
        it contains a logical constant with the value 'T' if the file conforms
        to it. This keyword is mandatory for the primary header and is not
        permitted in extension headers. A value of 'F', on the other hand,
        means that the file does not conform to the standard.

        We trust the 'SIMPLE' keyword blindly: if is says that the FITS image
        follows the standard, we believe it. Period. We do not consider the
        possibility (although this may change in the future, if we begin to
        work with much less reliable data) that the keyword has a value of 'T'
        while at the same time there are violations of the standard. That is
        why we instruct PyFITS to ignore any FITS standard violations we come

                       old date format was 'yy/mm/dd' and may be used only for

                       format is 'yyyy-mm-dd' or 'yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS[.sss]'.

                       ignored (and, thus, should not be used) if the time is

def find_files(paths, followlinks = True, pattern = None):
    """ Find all the regular files that can be found in the given paths.

    The method receives a variable number of paths and returns a list with all
    the existing regular files that were found at these locations. If a path
    corresponds to a regular file, it is simply added to the list, while if it
    points to a directory it is recursively walked top-down in search of
    regular files. In other words: if the path to a directory is given, all
    the regular files in the directory tree are included in the returned list.

    Keyword arguments:
    followlinks - by default, the method will walk down into symbolic links
                  that resolve to directories. You may set this to False to
                  disable visiting directories pointed to by symlinks. Note
                  that setting followlinks to True can lead to infinite
                  recursion if a link points to a parent directory of itself.
    pattern - the pattern, according to the rules used by the Unix shell (which
              are not the same as regular expressions) that the base name of a
              regular file must match to be considered when scanning the
              paths. Non-matching files are ignored.
