This module runs on parallel SExtractor on all the input FITS files, fully
leveraging multiple processors available on the machine. Both images with a too
large full width at half maximum) or elongation (ratio between its semi-major
and semi-minor axis lengths) are automatically discarded by fitting a Gaussian
distribution to the values and excluding those which are above a certain
sigma. Finally, the 'best-seeing' image, the optimal one on which to identify
sources, is found by identifying among the non-discarded images that whose
number of sources is at a given percentile and which has the best FWHM.

    """ High-level interface to the SExtractor catalog of each FITS image.

    As running SExtractor on an image is a CPU-expensive operation, in the
    order of seconds, this class uses the local filesystem as a cache, so that
    SExtractor does not have to be unnecessarily run twice. To achieve this,
    the SExtractor catalog is saved to a temporary file, whose path is stored
    in the FITS header of the image. In order to prevent an outdated catalog
    (that is, if the SExtractor configuration files are modified in between),
    the MD5 hash of the configuration files is also stored.

    """

    def __init__(self, path, maximum, margin, coaddk = keywords.coaddk):
        """ Instantiation method for the FITSeeingImage class.

        The path to the SExtractor catalog is read from the FITS header: if the
        keyword is not found, or if it is present but refers to a non-existent
        file, SExtractor has to be executed again. Even if the catalog exists,
        however, the MD5 of the SExtractor configuration files that were used
        when the catalog was created must be the same.

        The 'maximum' parameter determines the pixel value above which it is
        considered saturated. This value depends not only on the CCD, but also
        on the number of coadded images. If three images were coadded, for
        example, the effective saturation level equals three times the value of
        'saturation'. The number of effective coadds is read from the 'coaddk'
        parameter. If the keyword is missing, a value of one (that is, that the
        image consisted of a single exposure) is assumed.

        The 'margin' argument gives the width, in pixels, of the areas adjacent
        to the edges of the image that are to be ignored when detecting sources
        on the reference image. Stars whose center is fewer than this number of
        pixels from any border of the FITS image are not considered.
