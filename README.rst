LEMON
=====

LEMON_ is a differential-photometry pipeline, written in Python_, that determines the changes in the brightness of astronomical objects over time and compiles their measurements into `light curves`_. The aim of this program is to make it possible to completely reduce thousands of FITS images of time series in a matter of only a few hours, requiring minimal user interaction.

For example, to get the light curve of a transit of HAT-P-16b_:

::

    $ lemon astrometry data/*.fits HAT-P-16/
    $ lemon mosaic HAT-P-16/*.fits HAT-P-16-mosaic.fits
    $ lemon photometry HAT-P-16-mosaic.fits HAT-P-16/*.fits phot.LEMONdB
    $ lemon diffphot phot.LEMONdB curves.LEMONdB

The above commands produce, among many others, the following plot:
